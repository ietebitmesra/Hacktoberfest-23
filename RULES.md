PRs can be made to participating public repos on GitHub, those that have the Hacktoberfest topic. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.

**Humble Request !important**

All the enthusiastic contributors are requested to add their part carefully following the proper code block which is to be to be copy-pasted and then edited. Also, before sending a PR, it would be great if you yourself render the html page at least once to see how your changes are manifested. There have been instances where a single contribution destroyed the entire layout of the page, even affecting others' contributions.
